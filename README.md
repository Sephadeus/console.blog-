 ## Description
  
Console.blog() is an online mini blogging platform where both professional and aspiring developers alike can come together and discuss various technologies, programming languages, their experiences in the tech field, career insight and more. C.blog utilizes MySQL and Sequelize for database entries, Express.js for routing and API calls, Handlebars.js for view templating, and Node.js/NPM for managing dependencies and scripts.  Users can create an account, write, update, and post their own articles, and leave comments on other users' posts. 
  
- What was our motivation?
  
The intention behind Console.blog is to bring together people who are passionate about technology. Whether they be a developer, network architect, gamer, hacker, cryptominer, they are welcome here!
  
- What problem does it solve?
  
This blog gives users a space to share their thoughts.
  
- What did we learn?
  
Several lessons were learned from building this application. The importance of organization encompasses nearly all of them. This project grew 'too big for it's britches' too quickly, so to speak. There was one time during production that the app crashed because a variable was off by a "."! The other lessons were more focused on 'how' to do something, like add an event listener to several elements of the same class and how to make a proper API call so it does not throw an error.
  
- What makes our app different from others?
  
Retro gaming/Old school computer hacker theme!
  
- Some challenges we faced were:
  
As mentioned in the what did we learn section, most of the challenges were related to the method of how to do something and/or organization.
